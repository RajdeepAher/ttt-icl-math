Even if they are made whole by the bankruptcy proceedings, that\u2019s still money that they should have had access to at any time they wanted it. That may mean houses that weren\u2019t purchased, medical procedures that were left undone, and life savings lost.\n\nThere is a simultaneous drama of ruined lives playing out in the courtroom\n\nBankman-Fried is charged with seven counts: two counts of wire fraud and five conspiracy charges. As we near the end of the prosecution\u2019s case, I have been struck by how bizarre it all is. All the co-conspirators seem oddly younger than their years, as though they got stuck in the \u201cmath camp forever\u201d environment Bankman-Fried created for them and simply failed to grow up.",
