The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,\u201d the complaint states.",

In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: With no \"Big Four\" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022.",

The inflation report, though, also had some encouraging nuggets for financial markets underneath the surface. After ignoring prices for food and fuel, which Fed officials see as a better predictor of where inflation is heading, prices that consumers had to pay last month were in line with expectations. They also continued to decelerate from earlier months. A second economic report from the morning likewise offered both encouragement and caution for financial markets. It said slightly fewer US workers than expected applied for unemployment benefits last week. On one hand, it indicates a job market with few lay-offs, which means strength for the overall economy. But it could also be adding fuel to keep upward pressure on inflation.\n\nAfter the reports, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.7 per cent from 4.56 per cent late Wednesday.",
